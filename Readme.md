# Rector Rules

Some custom Rector rules that could be useful some day, or just as exercises.

[List of rules](./docs/rules_overview.md)


## Creating a new rule

Edit the `rector-recipe.php` file to describe your new rule and run `./bin/rector generate`.

Don't overthink it, you'll be able to edit the result later.
